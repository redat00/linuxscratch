# linuxscratch

! NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION, AT ALL !

Small repository containing my script where I'm trying to build a small Linux OS from scratch. For now the script is capable of building the kernel, and some other softwares such as nano, busybox, openssl. 

This idea would be to get a really simple OS working, running with sysvinit, systemd, or openrc, depending on which one is the easiest to implement. Adding the openssh server is also a goal. 

For those wondering, the root password is `test`.
